# Making Predictions with Vision Models

You can run the prediction as the following steps:

1. Load pre-trained and pre-quantized model.
2. Preprocess the input image.
3. Run inference with the model.
4. Postprocess the output.
5. Plot the result.







## Test the Vision API

You may change the models in each code snippet to test the Vision API.

To see the full list of available models for each task, you can run the following command:

```bash
